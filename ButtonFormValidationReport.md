# Button and Form Validation Report — BusBuddy.WPF

Date: 2025-08-10
Owner: Validation pass by GitHub Copilot

Summary
- Scope: Main navigation (MainWindow), Students, StudentForm, RouteManagementView, VehicleManagementView, ReportsView.
- Goals: Verify Command bindings exist, CanExecute gating, lifecycle and button logging present, theming applied; fix non-functional bindings.

Findings (Highlights)
- StudentsView.xaml: All toolbar ButtonAdv elements bind to ViewModel commands; grid action buttons use RelativeSource to Window DataContext. OK.
- StudentForm.xaml: ValidateAddress, ValidateData, Save, Cancel, SuggestRoutes, ViewOnMap, ImportCsv, ClearGlobalError commands present in StudentFormViewModel with Serilog logging. OK.
- RouteManagementView.xaml: All toolbar actions bound to RouteManagementViewModel commands; code-behind logs clicks and accessibility. OK.
- VehicleManagementView.xaml: Buttons bound to commands in VehicleManagementViewModel, but DataContext was not set in view constructor. FIXED by resolving IBusService via DI and setting DataContext to new VehicleManagementViewModel(busService).
- ReportsView.xaml: Many ButtonAdv bound to ReportsViewModel commands; DataContext was not ensured in code-behind. FIXED by setting DataContext = new ReportsViewModel() in constructor.
- MainWindow: Navigation uses Click handlers; each handler opens the respective dialog/window and logs lifecycle events. Theming applied at window level.

Changes Made
1) Views/Vehicle/VehicleManagementView.xaml.cs
   - Added DI resolution for IBusService and set DataContext = new VehicleManagementViewModel(busService).
   - Impact: Enables Add/Edit/Delete/Save/Refresh commands; CanExecute now evaluated correctly.

2) Views/Reports/ReportsView.xaml.cs
   - Ensured DataContext assigned to new ReportsViewModel when not already set.
   - Impact: Report generation, export, and print commands now execute; IsGeneratingReport visual shows.

Validation Notes
- Logging: All reviewed views have Serilog instrumentation for button clicks or command execution.
- Theming: SfSkinManager and SyncfusionThemeManager used across StudentForm and ReportsView; MainWindow applies FluentDark (fallback to FluentLight).
- CanExecute: VehicleManagementView and RouteManagementView notify CanExecuteChanged on selection/busy state; StudentForm SaveCommand uses CanSaveStudent predicate and CanSave binding.

Next Checks (deferred)
- Drivers modules DataContext and commands wiring.
- GoogleEarth and Fuel dialogs button command bindings.
- Expand audit to remaining views under Views/*.

Requirements coverage
- Inventory and verify core buttons/forms: Done (core views). Further views deferred.
- Command bindings and CanExecute: Done for core views.
- Execution logging and theming: Confirmed present.
- Fix non-functional buttons: Done for VehicleManagementView and ReportsView via DataContext setup.

Drivers Module — Audit and Fixes (2025-08-10)

Views audited: `Views/Driver/DriversView.xaml`, `Views/Driver/DriverForm.xaml`
ViewModels audited: `ViewModels/Driver/DriversViewModel.cs`, `ViewModels/Driver/DriverFormViewModel.cs`

Findings
- DriversView: Toolbar ButtonAdv bindings present (Add, Edit, Delete, Refresh, GenerateReports, ViewLicense, TrainingRecords). Selection binding updates `HasSelectedDriver` for CanExecute.
- DriverForm: Save/Cancel bound to `SaveDriverCommand` and `CancelCommand`; Syncfusion inputs and resources in place.

Fixes
1) Dialog close pattern
   - Added `RequestClose` event to `DriverFormViewModel`; raised `RequestClose(true)` on successful save and `RequestClose(false)` on cancel.
   - Subscribed/unsubscribed in `DriverForm.xaml.cs` and set `DialogResult` accordingly before closing.
2) Edit flow data handoff
   - In `DriversViewModel.ExecuteEditDriver`, resolved the form ViewModel and assigned `SelectedDriver` so it loads the entity for edit.
3) Dialog parenting
   - Set `Owner` on DriverForm for Add/Edit to active window for modal behavior and focus retention.

Validation
- Build: Passed after changes.
- Behavior: Edit/Add opens modal; Save/Cancel now close the dialog; list refreshes post-save; commands enable based on selection.
