SfSkinManager standardization report â€” August 9, 2025

Summary
- Default theme: FluentDark; fallback: FluentLight
- Applied SfSkinManager.ApplyThemeAsDefaultStyle = true before SetTheme calls
- Removed redundant FluentDarkTheme.xaml dictionaries; kept only Resources/SyncfusionV30_Validated_ResourceDictionary.xaml
- Added disposal via SfSkinManager.Dispose(this) in window OnClosed overrides

Views updated (code-behind)
- Views/Vehicle/VehicleForm.xaml.cs: FluentLight fallback; OnClosed disposal; logs
- Views/Driver/DriverForm.xaml.cs: FluentLight fallback; OnClosed disposal; logs
- Views/Bus/BusForm.xaml.cs: FluentLight fallback; OnClosed disposal; logs
- Views/Fuel/FuelReconciliationDialog.xaml.cs: FluentLight fallback; OnClosed disposal; logs
- Views/Fuel/FuelDialog.xaml.cs: Theme applied in ctor; OnClosed disposal
- Views/Bus/BusEditDialog.xaml.cs: Theme applied in ctors; OnClosed disposal
- Views/Bus/ConfirmationDialog.xaml.cs: Theme applied in ctors; OnClosed disposal
- Views/Bus/NotificationWindow.xaml.cs: Theme applied in ctors; OnClosed disposal
- Views/Activity/ActivityScheduleEditDialog.xaml.cs: Theme applied in ctor; OnClosed disposal
- Views/Route/RouteAssignmentView.xaml.cs: Applies theme to host window on load (UserControl)

XAML resource cleanup

Validation notes
- Shared dictionary Resources/SyncfusionV30_Validated_ResourceDictionary.xaml contains only colors/brushes; no duplicate ResourceDictionary declarations were found.
- Existing windows StudentsView and StudentForm already implemented ApplyTheme and disposal via SyncfusionThemeManager; left intact.
- App.xaml.cs and MainWindow already manage global theme selection; no behavior changes made beyond comment fix.

Testing checklist
- Launch app; toggle theme via UI (ComboBox/Toggle). Verify all dialogs/windows reflect theme immediately or on open.
- Open: VehicleForm, DriverForm, BusForm, FuelDialog, FuelReconciliationDialog, ActivityScheduleEditDialog, ConfirmationDialog, NotificationWindow.
- Check logs for messages: theme applied/fallback and disposal events; ensure no errors.
- Confirm no trial watermarks (license registered per bootstrap-20250809.txt).

Issues observed
- None during code review. Runtime verification pending.
