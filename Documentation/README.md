# 🚌 BusBuddy Project — Major Refactor Update (August 2025)

> Documentation Unification (August 2025): Former top-level `docs/` directory has been merged into this `Documentation/` hub. Theming checklist now at `Documentation/Theming/Theming-Audit-Checklist.md` and sample XAML moved to `Documentation/Samples/`. Remove any outdated references to `docs/` in external materials.

## 🚀 August 2025 Refactor: Canonicalization, Cleanup, and Data Modernization

**Summary of Accomplishments:**
- **Canonicalized DbContext:**
  - Removed all obsolete/duplicate `BusBuddyDbContext` files. All code now uses `BusBuddy.Core.Data.BusBuddyDbContext` for consistency and maintainability.
  - Updated every service, repository, and test to reference the canonical context only.
- **Restored SportsEvents Support:**
  - Added `DbSet<SportsEvent> SportsEvents` to the canonical DbContext, resolving all missing property errors and enabling full sports scheduling features.
- **Removed Legacy Vehicles:**
  - Fully removed the legacy `Vehicles` property and all related code, standardizing on `Buses` throughout the codebase and data model.
- **Improved JSON Data Seeding:**
  - Enhanced the seeding process with a new `wiley-school-district-data.json` file, supporting robust OCR-based student/family import for rapid onboarding.
  - All JSON import logic is now centralized and fetchable, with models and utilities documented and tracked.
- **Project Hygiene:**
  - Deep scan confirmed: no `.old`, `.bak`, `.backup`, `.tmp`, or duplicate files remain. All `.disabled` files are intentional and tracked for MVP toggling.
  - All changes are committed, tracked, and fetchable via GitHub and raw URLs.

**Impact:**
- ✅ Build is clean and stable; all business logic and UI code is consistent and modernized.
- ✅ Data seeding and onboarding are faster and more reliable.
- ✅ Project structure is easier to navigate and maintain.
- ✅ Fetchability and documentation are 100% up to date.
