# Documentation Archive - August 17, 2025

This directory contains archived instruction documents that have been consolidated or are no longer needed due to project progression.

## Archived Files

### Copilot Instructions (Legacy)
- `copilot-instructions-legacy-2025-08-17.md` - Original 766-line instruction file
- `copilot-instructions-clean-legacy-2025-08-17.md` - Clean version of instructions
- `copilot-instructions-recommendations-resolved-2025-08-17.md` - Recommendations file (issues resolved)

### VS Code Instructions (Legacy)
- `vscode-instructions-legacy-2025-08-17.md` - VS Code quick guide (superseded by README.md)

## Consolidation Summary

**Reason for Archival**: MVP completion and issue resolution made these files redundant:
- ✅ bbBuild fixed (was reported broken)
- ✅ XAML compliance achieved (no ListView violations)
- ✅ File sizes reduced (from 2117 to focused content)
- ✅ Repository documentation structure matured

**Current State**: Single consolidated instruction file at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (98 lines vs 766+ lines) provides focused production-ready guidance.

**Benefits of Consolidation**:
- Eliminated maintenance burden of multiple instruction files
- Removed outdated information and resolved issue references
- Focused on current production hardening priorities
- Aligned with mature repository documentation structure
