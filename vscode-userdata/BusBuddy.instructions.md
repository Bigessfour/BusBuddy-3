- **Concise responses** - conserve time with brief, focused answers
- **One-issue-at-a-time** approach for fixing build errors
- **Use PowerShell commands** not raw dotnet commands
- **Direct action** - fix issues immediately using available tools

### Debugging & Troubleshooting
For technical error resolution (e.g., CS0103, CS0246), see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Use these steps for project-specific issues:
- Run `bb-health` to diagnose environment issues.
- Check build output with `bb-build` for detailed error information.
- Use `bb-run` for runtime logging and testing.
- Export diagnostics with `bb-debug-export` (if available).

#### 🔧 **Problem Resolution Approach**ignment) and how to achieve a runnable MVP with minimal build errors.

## 🎯 **Project Status & Roadmap**

### Current Status: MVP Acceleration (Phase 2)
- **Goal**: Achieve a clean build (0 errors) and deliver a runnable application with student entry and route assignment by end-of-day.
- **Progress**: Reduced build errors from 87 to 4 by disabling non-MVP services (e.g., XAI, GoogleEarthEngine). PowerShell route demo (`bb-route-demo`) is fully operational.
- **Blockers**: 4 CS0246 errors in `AIEnhancedRouteService.cs` (to be resolved by disabling).

**MVP Priorities**:
- **Student Entry**: Form for adding students (name, address, phone, grade) with basic validation.
- **Route Assignment**: UI for assigning students to buses/drivers, generating schedules.
- **UI**: Syncfusion-based forms (`StudentsView.xaml`, `StudentForm.xaml`, `RoutesView.xaml`).
- **Data**: Entity Framework with SQLite for dev, simple CRUD for students/routes.

**Deferred Until Post-MVP**:
- XAI integration (e.g., `XAIService`, `OptimizedXAIService`).
- Google Earth Engine integration (e.g., `GoogleEarthEngineService`).
- Complex features: vehicle management, driver scheduling, maintenance, fuel tracking, advanced reporting.

**Next Steps** (48 Hours):
1. Disable `AIEnhancedRouteService.cs` to achieve clean build.
2. Implement student entry form and route assignment UI.
3. Validate MVP with `bb-mvp-check`.
4. Update documentation (`GROK-README.md`, `ANTI-REGRESSION-CHECKLIST.md`).

## 🚌 **Core Business Context**
- **School transportation management system** for bus fleet operations
- **Key MVP entities**: Students, Routes (defer Buses, Drivers, Maintenance)
- **Primary users**: Transportation coordinators
- **Critical MVP features**: Route assignments, student tracking

## 🎨 **UI/UX Standards**
- **Syncfusion controls preferred** over standard Windows Forms
- **Material Design theming** with consistent color schemes
- **Focus on working functionality** over perfect styling in MVP

## 💾 **Data Architecture**
- **Entity Framework Core** for data access
- **Simple direct queries** for MVP (defer complex repository patterns)
- **SQL Server backend** with proper connection management
- **Test database initialization** for development/testing

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

1. **Open the Project**:
   ```
   Open VS Code → Open Folder → Navigate to BusBuddy folder
   ```

2. **Load PowerShell Environment**:
   ```powershell
   pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "load-bus-buddy-profiles.ps1"
   bb-health -Quick
   ```

3. **Disable Non-MVP Services** (if build errors persist):
   ```powershell
   cd BusBuddy.Core/Services
   Rename-Item "AIEnhancedRouteService.cs" "AIEnhancedRouteService.cs.disabled"
   bb-build  # Verify clean build
   ```

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Use VS Code Task: `Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🏗️ BB: Build & Run (Default)"`
   - Or PowerShell: `bb-build && bb-run`

## 💬 **Communication Preferences**
- **Concise responses** - conserve time with brief, focused answers
- **One-issue-at-a-time** approach for fixing build errors
- **Use PowerShell commands** not raw dotnet commands
- **Direct action** - fix issues immediately using available tools

## 🎯 **MVP Readiness Criteria**
Use `bb-mvp-check` to validate:
- ✅ Application builds without errors
- ✅ Application starts and shows main window
- ✅ Student model exists and works
- ✅ Route model exists and works
- ✅ Basic UI forms are functional

## 🚫 **MVP Scope Limitations**
**Defer These Until MVP Works:**
- Complex vehicle management
- Advanced driver scheduling
- Maintenance tracking
- Fuel management
- Complex reporting
- Advanced route optimization (xAI integration can wait)

**Focus Only On:**
- Student data entry and display
- Route definition and assignment
- Basic navigation between forms
- Data persistence for students and routes
- **Enhance existing ViewModels** with additional functionality
- **Build on existing services** instead of creating competing implementations
- **Reuse existing models** and extend them if needed
- **Follow established patterns** found in existing codebase

**Documentation of Discoveries:**
- **Report findings**: Always mention what existing components were found
- **Gap analysis**: Identify what's missing vs. what exists
- **Integration plan**: Explain how new code will work with existing components
- **Avoid duplication**: Never create competing implementations without user approval

#### 🔧 **Problem Resolution Approach**ns.md`** - Documentation-first development methodology
- **MVP Exception**: During MVP phase, prioritize functionality over perfect documentation compliance
- **Post-MVP Transition**: After MVP completion, all development MUST follow documentation-first standards

**⚠️ Development Approach Alignment:**
- **MVP Phase (Current)**: Balanced approach - reference documentation when possible, prioritize working code
- **Phase 2+ (Future)**: Full documentation-first compliance required per copilot-instructions.md
- **Technical Debt**: Document any MVP shortcuts for Phase 2 cleanup

## Coding Standards, Domain Knowledge, and Preferences

### Greenfield Reset: MVP Acceleration Plan

We're aligning on the MVP-first approach—focusing on core functionality to get routes and schedules operational without distractions. Based on the provided build log, the WPF project compiles cleanly (0 errors, 0 warnings in 35.84s), producing a runnable `BusBuddy.WPF.exe`. The CS0103 errors ("name does not exist in current context") you're seeing are likely VS Code IntelliSense artifacts, not actual build blockers. From the GROK-README.md history (August 2, 2025 updates), these were resolved by adding `partial` keywords to all `*.xaml.cs` code-behind files (e.g., `public partial class MainWindow : Window`). If build succeeds via `dotnet build`, trust that over editor warnings—it's a known OmniSharp limitation with XAML projects.

#### MVP Critical Path (Next 48 Hours)
Using greenfield reset: Strip to essentials, build iteratively. Target: Runnable app with student entry and basic route assignment by end-of-day.

| Priority | Feature | Implementation Steps | Status/Blockers |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 (High) | Student Database (Entities/Models) | - Add `Student.cs` to BusBuddy.Core/Models: Properties like `StudentId`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Grade`.<br>- Update EF DbContext (`BusBuddyDbContext.cs`) with `DbSet<Student>`.<br>- Add basic data annotations (e.g., `[Required]`, `[StringLength(100)]` for address).<br>- Seed sample data (10-15 students) via `OnModelCreating`. | Ready—leverage existing EF setup. No blockers; models align with Driver/Vehicle patterns. |
| 2 (High) | Address Validation | - Basic: Regex in ViewModel for US addresses (e.g., street + city + state + ZIP).<br>- MVP Stub: Add `ValidateAddress(string address)` method in a service—return bool + error message.<br>- Future: Hook to free API (e.g., USPS or Google Geocoding if needed).<br>- Integrate into student form (error tooltip on invalid input). | Greenfield simple—implement in Core/Services. Defer full geocoding; use for form validation only. |
| 3 (Critical) | MVP Forms/UI (Student Intake + Route Building) | - New Views: `StudentsView.xaml` (SfDataGrid for list), `StudentForm.xaml` (inputs for name/address, validation on submit).<br>- Route Form: `RoutesView.xaml`—Dropdowns for assigning students to vehicles/drivers, basic schedule fields.<br>- ViewModels: Bind to EF (e.g., `StudentsViewModel` with `LoadStudentsAsync()`, `AddStudentAsync()`).<br>- Navigation: Add to `MainWindow.xaml` menu.<br>- Theme: Apply FluentDark consistently. | Partial—build on existing Dashboard/Drivers views. Fix any XAML parsing by ensuring balanced tags. Target SfInput/SfGrid for pro look. |
| 4 (Medium) | Basic Route/Schedule Output | - Generate simple list: Students → Assigned Bus/Driver/Time.<br>- Output to grid or export (CSV for now).<br>- No optimization yet—manual assignment in UI. | Ties into forms; use existing Activity model as base. |
| 5 (Low) | Data/Prod DB Fix | - Dev: Use SQLite (existing EF config).<br>- Prod: Defer SQL Server migration—focus on forms first, swap connection string later. | Not blocking MVP; current setup works for testing. |

### **Application Execution - LOCKED METHOD**
**CRITICAL: Use ONLY this method to run BusBuddy application**

**✅ FINAL SOLUTION: Explicit project targeting required when .sln and .csproj coexist**

**PRIMARY RUN COMMAND:**
```powershell
dotnet run --project BusBuddy.csproj
```

**Build and Run Sequence:**
1. **Clean**: `dotnet clean BusBuddy.csproj`
2. **Build**: `dotnet build BusBuddy.csproj`  
3. **Run**: `dotnet run --project BusBuddy.csproj`
4. **Application should display**: WPF Dashboard window

**Why This Is Required:**
- **Both files exist**: `.sln` and `.csproj` in same directory causes ambiguity
- **dotnet behavior**: Always asks "which project?" when multiple exist
- **Explicit targeting**: Only way to avoid the prompt
- **Standard practice**: Normal .NET development pattern

**Alternative Commands:**
```powershell
# Solution-level operations (when needed)
dotnet build "BusBuddy Blazer.sln"
dotnet clean "BusBuddy Blazer.sln"

# Direct executable (after build)
.\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows\BusBuddy.exe
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Command works consistently every time without prompts
- Application launches as WPF desktop application  
- Dashboard window should appear
- Syncfusion controls should be properly initialized
- No console window should remain open
