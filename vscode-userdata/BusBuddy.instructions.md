# BusBuddy Project Guidelines

**Purpose**: Guides developers and AI assistants on BusBuddy MVP goals, project context, and development workflows. For technical standards, compliance, and anti-regression rules, see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

**Scope**: Defines what to build (student entry, ro#### üí¨ **Communication Preferences**
- **Concise responses** - conserve time with brief, focused answers
- **One-issue-at-a-time** approach for fixing build errors
- **Use PowerShell commands** not raw dotnet commands
- **Direct action** - fix issues immediately using available tools

### Debugging & Troubleshooting
For technical error resolution (e.g., CS0103, CS0246), see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Use these steps for project-specific issues:
- Run `bbHealth` to diagnose environment issues.
- Check build output with `bbBuild` for detailed error information.
- Use `bbRun` for runtime logging and testing.
- Export diagnostics with available PowerShell functions.

#### üîß **Problem Resolution Approach**ignment) and how to achieve a runnable MVP with minimal build errors.

## üéØ **Project Status & Roadmap**

### Current Status: MVP Acceleration (Phase 2)
- **Goal**: Achieve a clean build (0 errors) and deliver a runnable application with student entry and route assignment by end-of-day.
- **Progress**: Reduced build errors from 87 to 4 by disabling non-MVP services (e.g., XAI, GoogleEarthEngine). PowerShell route demo (`bb-route-demo`) is fully operational.
- **Blockers**: 4 CS0246 errors in `AIEnhancedRouteService.cs` (to be resolved by disabling).

**MVP Priorities**:
- **Student Entry**: Form for adding students (name, address, phone, grade) with basic validation.
- **Route Assignment**: UI for assigning students to buses/drivers, generating schedules.
- **UI**: Syncfusion-based forms (`StudentsView.xaml`, `StudentForm.xaml`, `RoutesView.xaml`).
- Command works consistently every time without prompts
- Application launches as WPF desktop application  
- Dashboard window should appear
- Syncfusion controls should be properly initialized
- No console window should remain open

**Development Best Practices:**
1. **Getting Started**: Always refer to component-specific "Getting Started" guides
2. **Code Examples**: Use sample browser with hundreds of code examples
3. **API Reference**: Detailed object hierarchy and settings documentation
4. **Search First**: Use search functionality for specific features
5. **Licensing**: Proper license key registration to avoid runtime dialogs

**Resource Utilization:**
- **Knowledge Base**: Common questions and solutions
- **Community Forums**: Peer support and discussions  
- **Support Tickets**: Direct technical assistance
- **Feedback Portal**: Feature requests and suggestions

**Version Compatibility:**
- **Target .NET 8.0+** (Support for .NET 6.0/7.0 discontinued in 2025 Volume 1)
- **Regular updates** following Syncfusion release cycles
- **Backward compatibility** considerations for existing components

#### üíæ **Data Architecture**
- **Entity Framework Core** for data access
- **Repository pattern** with dependency injection
- **SQL Server backend** with proper connection management
- **Test database initialization** for development/testing

#### üß™ **Testing Approach**
- **UI tests** in `BusBuddy.Tests/UI/` directory
- **Integration tests** for data layer operations
- **Coverage reports** generated via PowerShell scripts
- **Avoid legacy test files** - consolidate into organized structure

#### üîß **Development Tools**
- **PowerShell (pwsh)** for ALL commands - use abbreviated pwsh when possible
- **Single build approach** - run one build, get data, move on - no repetitive builds
- **VS Code tasks** for build/test operations
- **Syncfusion licensing** handled via helper classes
- **Git hooks** for code quality enforcement

**‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN TECHNICAL DEBT (Post-MVP Cleanup Required):**
- **PowerShell Modules**: Current modules may not fully comply with Microsoft standards
- **Write-Host Usage**: Some PowerShell scripts use Write-Host instead of proper output streams
- **Module Structure**: Large monolithic modules need refactoring per Microsoft guidelines
- **Documentation Links**: Not all Syncfusion implementations include official documentation references

**MVP Approach**: These items don't block MVP functionality but must be addressed in Phase 2

#### ÔøΩ **Communication Preferences**
- **Concise responses** - conserve time with brief, focused answers
- **One-issue-at-a-time** approach for fixing build errors
- **Use PowerShell commands** not raw dotnet commands
- **Direct action** - fix issues immediately using available tools

#### üîß **Problem Resolution Approach**
- **Incremental fixes first** - Always attempt targeted edits before complete rebuilds
- **Assess corruption level** - Check actual errors and their scope before deciding approach
- **User consultation** - Let the user decide on complete overhauls vs. targeted fixes
- **Error analysis** - Identify root causes (missing methods, property name mismatches, duplicates)
- **Minimal viable fix** - Use the smallest change that resolves the issue
- **Escalation path**: 
  1. First: Targeted edits for specific errors
  2. Second: Consult user if issues appear complex
  3. Last resort: Complete rebuild only with user approval

#### üèóÔ∏è **Syncfusion Implementation Requirements**

**CRITICAL RULE: Only Use Official Syncfusion Documentation**
- **Reference ONLY**: https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.html
- **No custom fixes**: Use only documented Syncfusion APIs, methods, and examples
- **No invented code**: Every Syncfusion implementation must be found in official docs
- **No modifications** to documented patterns without verifying in docs

**Documentation-First Development Process:**
1. **Search Syncfusion docs** for the specific control/feature needed
2. **Find official examples** in the documentation or sample browser
3. **Copy exact patterns** from Syncfusion's documented examples
4. **Test with documented parameters** and properties only
5. **No modifications** to documented patterns without verifying in docs

**Common Syncfusion Controls - Documentation Required:**
- **RibbonControlAdv**: Use Header.AddMainItem() for tabs (documented pattern)
- **DockingManager**: Use DockingStyle enum for docking operations
- **TileLayout**: Use LayoutGroup and HubTile as per documentation
- **SfDataGrid**: Follow documented binding and column configuration patterns
- **ChartControl**: Use only documented series types and properties
- **SfButton**: Apply only documented style properties and themes

**Forbidden Practices:**
- ‚ùå **NO custom Syncfusion extensions** or helper methods
- ‚ùå **NO invented property combinations** not shown in docs
- ‚ùå **NO assumed API patterns** based on other frameworks
- ‚ùå **NO "enhanced" wrappers** around Syncfusion controls
- ‚ùå **NO undocumented parameters** or method calls

**Required Verification Steps:**
1. **Before any Syncfusion code**: Search help.syncfusion.com for exact usage
2. **Cross-reference examples**: Find matching code in Syncfusion's sample browser
3. **API validation**: Verify all properties/methods exist in official API reference
4. **Documentation links**: Include reference to specific Syncfusion doc page used

**Example of Correct Documentation-Based Implementation:**
```csharp
// Based on official Syncfusion RibbonControlAdv documentation
var tabItem = new TabHost
{
    Text = "Dashboard"
};
_ribbonControl.Header.AddMainItem(tabItem); // Documented method

// Based on official DockingManager documentation  
_dockingManager.DockControl(panel, this, DockingStyle.Left, 280); // Documented enum
```
