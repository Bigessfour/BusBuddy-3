```

### Step 2: Wait for Google Drive Sync
```powershell
# Make sure Google Drive has fully synced the BusBuddy folder

# Verify: All files are downloaded (no cloud icons)
```

### Step 3: Navigate and Run Setup
```powershell

```

### Step 4: Open VS Code

# ðŸšŒ BusBuddy Enhanced Development Profile v2.0
#    Tool-First Development Environment
```

After setup, you'll have these commands immediately available:
