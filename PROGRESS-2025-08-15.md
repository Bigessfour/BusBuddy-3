# BusBuddy Progress — 2025-08-15

This document captures the current state after closing recent PRs and outlines next steps toward production hardening.

## Current state
- MVP: Achieved (commit 29b7dc1) — core student management and route assignment validated.
- Tests: ≥75% coverage (per README metrics and current CI reports).
- PowerShell compliance: ~45% — known issues include empty catch blocks and missing ShouldProcess in `BusBuddy.psm1`.
- Closed PRs reviewed (via GitLens and GH CLI):
  - #1 Simplify CI pipeline for .NET 9 WPF (build/test/migrate/publish)
  - #2 feature/update ci and index
  - No regressions observed locally; further validation pending bb anti-regression and XAML validation aliases.

## CI status
- Recent runs (gh run list) show failures (status X) on feature branches:
  - Workflows: “BusBuddy CI”, “Code Quality”, “Duplicate File…”, “CI PR Gate”.
  - Action: fix YAML indentation (two-space standard), ensure Azure SQL firewall cleanup uses `if: always()` and that license/env wiring is robust.

## Next steps (actionable)
1) PowerShell module compliance (priority)
- Replace empty `catch {}` blocks with proper handling and logging; rethrow or return as appropriate.
- Add `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess = $true)]` and guard impactful operations with `$PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess()`.
- Ensure explicit `Export-ModuleMember` for public functions; remove any `Write-Host` (use `Write-Information` / `Write-Output`).

  - ShouldProcess: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/should-process
  - Output streams: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-output-streams

2) Syncfusion-only UI migration
- Run XAML validation and remove any remaining standard WPF controls in favor of Syncfusion (e.g., replace `<DataGrid>` with `syncfusion:SfDataGrid`).
- Verify Syncfusion namespaces and license registration early in `App.xaml.cs`.

  - API: https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Grid.SfDataGrid.html

3) CI pipeline fixes
- Ensure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` uses two-space indentation throughout.
- Keep secrets/env wiring; ensure Azure SQL firewall cleanup step runs with `if: always()`.
- Generate and upload TRX and code coverage artifacts; ensure dotnet SDK 9.x is installed.

4) Documentation and guidance alignment
- Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to match `PowerShell/Profiles/BusBuddyProfile.ps1` and `README.md` terms (aliases, bb* commands, standards).
- Cross-link standards and add doc links in code comments where practical.

5) Production hardening — logging and error handling
- Adopt Serilog across app and tests; replace `Console.WriteLine`/`Debug.WriteLine`.
- Add basic try/catch around data operations, user-friendly messages, and structured error logging.
- References:
  - Serilog: https://serilog.net/ and https://github.com/serilog/serilog-extensions-hosting

6) Route optimization (post-compliance)
- Begin with heuristic improvements; add unit tests under `BusBuddy.Tests/SchedulerTests/`.

7) Environment verification
- Confirm tooling installed and authenticated: GitKraken Free, GitHub CLI (gh), GitLens, NUnit Test Runner.

## Tools used today
- GitLens (VS Code) — reviewed commit history around 29b7dc1 and recent PR merges.
- GitHub CLI — listed closed PRs and recent CI runs.
- BusBuddy Dev Shell — verified bb* aliases availability and attempted health/regression checks.

```

## Verification checklist
- Repository state
  - [ ] GitLens shows commit 29b7dc1 present on the active branch (main/develop) and tagged as MVP.
  - [ ] Closed PRs (#1, #2) changes are reflected in commit history or superseded by newer merges.
- PowerShell compliance
  - [ ] No empty `catch {}` blocks remain in `PowerShell/BusBuddy.psm1`.
  - [ ] Functions with side effects implement ShouldProcess and use `$PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess()`.
  - [ ] No `Write-Host` usages remain; output/logging via proper streams.
- UI migration
  - [ ] `bbXamlValidate` passes — no standard WPF controls where Syncfusion equivalents exist.
  - [ ] Syncfusion license is registered and UI loads without license dialogs.
- CI health
  - [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` validates (two-space indentation; steps complete successfully).
  - [ ] CI uploads TRX and coverage; recent runs show success for build-and-test jobs.
  - [ ] Azure SQL firewall cleanup runs with `if: always()`.
- Tests and coverage
  - [ ] `bbTest` succeeds locally; coverage ≥75% and trending upward.
- Logging and resilience
  - [ ] Serilog initialized; no Console/Debug/Trace logging remains in production code.
