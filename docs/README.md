## Documentation Moved

The former `docs/` directory has been unified into the central `Documentation/` hub.

Current locations:
- Theming checklist: `Documentation/Theming/Theming-Audit-Checklist.md`
- Samples: `Documentation/Samples/`

This folder is retained temporarily as a placeholder. New documentation should be added under `Documentation/`.

Planned removal date: Post-MVP cleanup (remove after all external links are updated).
